How to play PONG-PONG:

The red block can only be destroyed my the white ball. 

Move the paddle with you mouse to bounce the ball towards the blocks. 

Once all blocks have been destroyed, only then will you win.

Be careful though, if you let the ball get passed the paddle and fall into the void, you lose a life. 
Lose all five lives and it results in a game over. Makeing you restart the game entirely.
